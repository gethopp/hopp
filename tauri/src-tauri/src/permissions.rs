//! Cross-platform permissions checking module.
//!
//! This module provides a unified interface for checking system permissions across different
//! operating systems. It uses conditional compilation to load platform-specific implementations
//! while exposing a consistent API.
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! - **macOS**: Uses native system APIs (Core Graphics, Accessibility, AVFoundation)
//! - **Other platforms**: Default implementation that returns `true` for all permissions
// Platform-specific modules
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
#[path = "permissions/macos.rs"]
mod platform;

#[cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))]
#[path = "permissions/default.rs"]
