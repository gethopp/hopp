Rooms are permanent, named meeting spots. Some rooms for example can be `Stand-ups`, `Mob Programming`, `Planning`, `Retrospectives`, etc.

You can just hop into a room and start collaborating with your teammates. Additionally, rooms allow more than 2 users to collaborate in a single call, and do not request a call request to be made.

## Creating a room

Click on the top right corner of the app, and click on the `+` button.

Then give a name to your room, and click on the `Create room` button.

Do not worry, you can always rename your room later.

<Image src={room} class="rounded-md max-w-[300px] mx-auto mt-6" alt="Join room" />

## Joining a room

To join a room, all you have to do is click on the room tile you want to join.

## More features to components

We want to improve room experience, and some features we will add in the future are:

1. Favourite a room
2. See who is in the room without joining
3. Subscribe to a room so you can get notified when someone joins

If you want to tackle any of these features, please open an issue on our GitHub repository and you can work on it.

## Rooms in web app

To accommodate the lack of native app support for Linux, we support room calls inside the web application.

Currently, you can join a room via a link. There are limitations though: you cannot point or control your teammates' computers.

We will incrementally improve room support in the web app while also working on our Linux client. Read more about Linux support [here](https://docs.gethopp.app/quick-start/local-development/supported-platforms/#linux-support).
