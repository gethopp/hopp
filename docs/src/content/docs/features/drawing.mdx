Drawing is a beta feature in Hopp 🖍️ It allows you to draw on the screen of your teammates.

If you try the drawing feature, please share feedback with us, so we can improve it 🙏

## How to use drawing as a Controller

When you are in a call, you can click the drawing button in the control panel to start drawing.

  controls
  class="rounded-md max-w-full mx-auto mt-6"
  autoplay
  loop
  muted

By default, the drawing is temporary and will be cleared after 3 seconds. You can change this by clicking the settings button in the control panel, and then enable the "Persist until right click" option. You can also see this in the above video demo.

## How to use drawing as a Sharer

You can also draw on your own screen while sharing:

1. Click the drawing button in the call controls to enable drawing mode.
2. You can configure the drawing mode from the three dots menu:
   - **Temporary**: Drawings will be cleared after 3 seconds (default).
   - **Persist until right click**: Drawings remain on screen until you right-click to clear them.
3. To exit drawing mode, press **Escape**.
