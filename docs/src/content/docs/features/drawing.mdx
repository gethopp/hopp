Drawing is a beta feature in Hopp 🖍️ It allows you to draw on the screen of your teammates.

If you try the drawing feature, please share feedback with us, so we can improve it 🙏

## How to use drawing

When you are in a call, you can click the drawing button in the control panel to start drawing.

  controls
  class="rounded-md max-w-full mx-auto mt-6"
  autoplay
  loop

By default, the drawing is temporary and will be cleared after 3 seconds. You can change this by clicking the settings button in the control panel, and then enable the "Persist until right click" option. You can also see this in the above video demo.

## Limitations

Currently, we only support drawing from Controllers, and not from the Sharer.
